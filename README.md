## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis application built to help banks identify **high-risk customers** and reduce churn. 

Unlike typical dashboards that just show charts, this application includes a **custom-built Risk Scoring Engine** that segments customers based on their probability of leaving. It provides actionable recommendations (Strategic Takeaways) to help relationship managers prioritize retention efforts.

**Key Objective:** Transform raw banking data into strategic business decisions using Python & SQL.
